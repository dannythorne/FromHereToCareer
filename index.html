<h1>From Here To Career</h1>

<p>Notes about pursuing a career in computing.
For students of
<a href="http://www.ruralup.org/">Rural Up! Code Academy</a>
courses.</p>

<h2>Careers</h2>

<p>Lots of information about computing
careers is provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
and the Association of Computing Machinery.</p>

<h3>Bootcamps</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamps/">https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamps/</a></p>

<p>Expensive and intensive but generally run in assocation with employers who want
to hire the graduates.</p>

</section>

<h3>College</h3>

<p>Best prep for pursuing a computer science degree in college:
take as much mathematics as possible -- and love it!</p>

<p>If computer science is not your primary interest, at least
consider minoring in it. It dovetails productively with
many fields in the 21st century and will likely improve
your marketability even outside of traditional computing
careers.</p>

<h2>Make Stuff</h2>

<p>Always be building! Make stuff and put it on GitHub.  Prospective employers
will want to see that you can get stuff done. Your GitHub account will probably
be the most important part of your application for any programming job. I tell
my students that their GitHub account is their resume.</p>

<h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>

<section>
Starting your own technology company is easier than it's ever been before, but
that means it's easier for everyone else, too. Think about what really sets you
apart. Do you have special insight into an opportunity, or problem that needs
to be solved? What are you the more passionate about than anyone else? What can
you become the best in the world at?
</section>

<section>
One thing that all entrepreneurial teams do well is sales. You don't have a
business until you have customers. If you're not great at sales, recruit
someone who is to join your team. Who do you know who can convince their
parents or teachers to do something fun? Who can get people to show up to a
party or school event? These take the same skills as selling your product to
customers.
