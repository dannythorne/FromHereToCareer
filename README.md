For students of Rural Up! Code Academy courses.

## Careers

Lots of information about computing
careers is provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
and the Association of Computing Machinery.

### Bootcamps

Expensive and intensive but generally run in assocation with employers who want
to hire the graduates.

### College

Best prep for pursuing a computer science degree in college:
take as much mathematics as possible -- and love it!

If computer science is not your primary interest, at least
consider minoring in it. It dovetails productively with
many fields in the 21st century and will likely improve
your marketability even outside of traditional computing
careers.

## Networking/Marketing

### LinkedIn

### GitHub

## Make Stuff

Always be building! Make stuff and put it on GitHub.  Prospective employers
will want to see that you can get stuff done. Your GitHub account will probably
be the most important part of your application for any programming job. I tell
my students that their GitHub account is their resume.

## Entrepreneurship
